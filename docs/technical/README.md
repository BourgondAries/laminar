**Remarks**

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. 
You could read more about that over [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation). It can also be applied to software processes.
I have to note here that there are some syntactic errors in those diagrams which are left to be resolved any time soon.
